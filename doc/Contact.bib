	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Ecologists have long been interested in linking individual behavior with higher-level processes. For motile species, this ‘upscaling’ is governed by how well any given movement strategy maximizes encounters with positive factors, and minimizes encounters with negative factors. Despite the importance of encounter events for a broad range of ecological processes, encounter theory has not kept pace with developments in animal tracking or movement modeling. Furthermore, existing work has focused primarily on the relationship between animal movement and encounter \textit{rates} while no theoretical framework exists for directly relating individual movement with the spatial \textit{locations} of encounter events in the environment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Here, we bridge this gap by introducing a new theoretical concept describing the long-term encounter location probabilities for movement within home ranges, termed the conditional distribution of encounters (CDE). We then derive this distribution, as well as confidence intervals, implement its statistical estimator into open source software, and demonstrate the broad ecological relevance of this novel concept.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We first use simulated data to show how our estimator provides asymptotically consistent estimates. We then demonstrate the general utility of this method for three simulation-based scenarios that occur routinely in biological systems: i) a population of individuals with home ranges that overlap with neighbors; ii) a pair of individuals with a hard territorial border between their home ranges; and iii) a predator with a large home range that encompassed the home ranges of multiple prey individuals. Using GPS data from white-faced capuchins (\textit{Cebus capucinus}) tracked on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and sleepy lizards (\textit{Tiliqua rugosa}) tracked in Bundey, South Australia, we then show how the CDE can be used to estimate the locations of territorial borders, identify key resources, quantify the location-specific potential for competition, and/or identify any changes in behaviour that directly result from location-specific encounter probability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}This novel target distribution enables researchers to better understand the dynamics of populations of interacting individuals. Notably, the general estimation framework developed in this work builds straightforwardly off of home range estimation and requires no specialised data collection protocols. This method is now openly available via the ctmm R package.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Intraspecific interactions between individuals or groups of individuals of the same species are an important component of population dynamics. Interactions can be static, such as spatial overlap, or dynamic based on the interactions of movements, and can be mediated through communication, such as the deployment of scent marks. Interactions and their behavioural outcomes can be difficult to determine, especially for species that live at low densities. With the use of GPS collars we quantify both static and dynamic interactions between male cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and the behavioural outcomes. The 99\% home-ranges of males overlapped significantly while there was little overlap of the 50\% home-ranges. Despite this overlap, male cheetahs rarely came into close proximity of one another, possibly because presence was communicated through frequent visits to marking posts. The minimum distance between individuals in a dyad ranged from 89m to 196m but the average proximity between individuals ranged from 17,145 ± 6,865m to 26,367 ± 11,288m. Possible interactions took place more frequently at night than by day and occurred mostly in the 50\% home-range of one individual of a dyad or where cores of both individuals overlapped. After a possible encounter male cheetahs stayed in close proximity to each other for up to 6 hours, which could be the result of a territory defence strategy or the presence of a receptive female. We believe that one of the encounters between a singleton and a 5-male coalition resulted in the death of the singleton. Our results give new insights into cheetah interactions, which could help our understanding of ecological processes such as disease transmission.},

	abstract = {Datasets from which wildlife contact networks of epidemiological importance can be inferred are becoming increasingly common. A largely unexplored facet of these data is finding evidence of spatial constraints on who has contact with whom, despite theoretical epidemiologists having long realized spatial constraints can play a critical role in infectious disease dynamics. A graph dissimilarity measure is proposed to quantify how close an observed contact network is to being purely spatial whereby its edges are completely determined by the spatial arrangement of its nodes. Statistical techniques are also used to fit a series of mechanistic models for contact rates between individuals to the binary edge data representing presence or absence of observed contact. These are the basis for a second measure that quantifies the extent to which contacts are being mediated by distance. We apply these methods to a set of 128 contact networks of field voles (Microtus agrestis) inferred from mark–recapture data collected over 7 years and from four sites. Large fluctuations in vole abundance allow us to demonstrate that the networks become increasingly similar to spatial proximity graphs as vole density increases. The average number of contacts, , was (i) positively correlated with vole density across the range of observed densities and (ii) for two of the four sites a saturating function of density. The implications for pathogen persistence in wildlife may be that persistence is relatively unaffected by fluctuations in host density because at low density  is low but hosts move more freely, and at high density  is high but transmission is hampered by local build-up of infected or recovered animals.},

	abstract = {Animals use a variety of proximate cues to assess habitat quality when resources vary spatiotemporally. Two nonmutually exclusive strategies to assess habitat quality involve either direct assessment of landscape features or observation of social cues from conspecifics as a form of information transfer about forage resources. The conspecific attraction hypothesis proposes that individual space use is dependent on the distribution of conspecifics rather than the location of resource patches, whereas the resource dispersion hypothesis proposes that individual space use and social association are driven by the abundance and distribution of resources. We tested the conspecific attraction and the resource dispersion hypotheses as two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses explaining social association and of adult female caribou (Rangifer tarandus). We used location data from GPS collars to estimate interannual site fidelity and networks representing home range overlap and social associations among individual caribou. We found that home range overlap and social associations were correlated with resource distribution in summer and conspecific attraction in winter. In summer, when resources were distributed relatively homogeneously, interannual site fidelity was high and home range overlap and social associations were low. Conversely, in winter when resources were distributed relatively heterogeneously, interannual site fidelity was low and home range overlap and social associations were high. As access to resources changes across seasons, caribou appear to alter social behavior and space use. In summer, caribou may use cues associated with the distribution of forage, and in winter caribou may use cues from conspecifics to access forage. Our results have broad implications for our understanding of caribou socioecology, suggesting that caribou use season-specific strategies to locate forage. Caribou populations continue to decline globally, and our finding that conspecific attraction is likely related to access to forage suggests that further fragmentation of caribou habitat could limit social association among caribou, particularly in winter when access to resources may be limited.},

	abstract = {Social structure can regulate information and pathogen transmission via social contact or proximity, which ultimately affects individual fitness. In theory, the same network properties that favor social information transmission also favor the spread of socially-transmitted pathogens, creating a trade-off between them. The mechanisms underlying the development and stability of individual relationships considering this trade-off remain underexplored. Here, we outline the evolutionary mechanisms of social transmission and hypothesize that network topology can be optimized in a way that balances the costs and benefits of social relationships. In this context, emergent network properties might reflect a trade-off between information and pathogen transmission in animal societies. We then propose an implementation of Hinde’s classical framework by incorporating the costs of socializing in a negative feedback loop in the emergence of social structure. We hope this manuscript encourages research into this underxplored social trade-off and the evolutionary processes underlying it.},

	abstract = {Animal movements arise from complex interactions of individuals with their environment, including both conspecific and heterospecific individuals. Animals may be attracted to each other for mating, social foraging, or information gain, or may keep at a distance from others to avoid aggressive encounters related to, e.g., interference competition, territoriality, or predation. With modern tracking technology, more datasets are emerging that allow to investigate fine-scale interactions between free-ranging individuals from movement data, however, few methods exist to disentangle fine-scale behavioural responses of interacting individuals when these are highly individual-specific. In a framework of step-selection functions, we related movements decisions of individuals to dynamic occurrence distributions of other individuals obtained through kriging of their movement paths. Using simulated data, we tested the method's ability to identify various combinations of attraction, avoidance, and neutrality between individuals, including asymmetric (i.e. non-mutual) behaviours. Additionally, we analysed radio-telemetry data from concurrently tracked small rodents (bank vole, Myodes glareolus) to test whether our method could detect biologically plausible behaviours. We found that our method was able to successfully detect and distinguish between fine-scale interactions (attraction, avoidance, neutrality), even when these were asymmetric between individuals. The method worked best when confounding factors were taken into account in the step-selection function. However, even when failing to do so (e.g. due to missing information), interactions could be reasonably identified. In bank voles, responses depended strongly on the sexes of the involved individuals and matched expectations. Our approach can be combined with conventional uses of step-selection functions to tease apart the various drivers of movement, e.g. the influence of the physical and the social environment. In addition, the method is particularly useful in studying interactions when responses are highly individual-specific, i.e. vary between and towards different individuals, making our method suitable for both single-species and multi-species analyses (e.g. in the context of predation or competition).},

	abstract = {Understanding how animals interact with their physical and social environment is a major question in ecology, but separating between these factors is often challenging. Observed interaction rates may reflect social behaviour – preferences or avoidance of conspecifics or certain phenotypes. Yet, environmental spatiotemporal heterogeneity also affects individual space use and interaction rates. For instance, clumped and ephemeral resources may force individuals to aggregate independently of sociality. Proximity-based social networks (PBSNs) are becoming increasingly popular for studying social structures thanks to the parallel improvement of biotracking technologies and network randomization methods. While current methods focus on swapping individual identities among network nodes or in the data streams that underlies the network (e.g. individuals movement paths), we still need better tools to distinguish between the contribution of sociality and other factors towards those interactions. We propose a novel method that randomizes path segments among different time stamps within each individual separately (Part I). Temporal randomization of whole path segments (e.g. full days) retains their original spatial structure while decoupling synchronization among individuals. This allows researchers to compare observed dyadic association rates with those expected by chance given explicit space use of the individuals in each dyad. Further, since environmental changes are commonly much slower than the duration of social interactions, we can differentiate between these two factors (Part II). First, an individual's path is divided into successive time windows (e.g. weeks), and days are randomized within each time window. Then, by exploring how the deviations between randomized and observed networks change as a function of time window length, we can refine our null model to account also for temporal changes in the activity areas. We used biased-correlated random walk models to simulate populations of socially indifferent or sociable agents for testing our method for both false-positive and negative errors. Applying the method to a data set of GPS-tracked sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) demonstrated its ability to reveal the social organization in free-ranging animals while accounting for confounding factors of environmental spatiotemporal heterogeneity. We demonstrate that this method is robust to sampling bias and argue that it is applicable for a wide range of systems and tracking techniques, and can be extended to test for preferential phenotypic assortment within PBSNs.},

Individual variation in movement traits is an important axis of animal personality, particularly in the context of foraging ecology. We tested whether individual caribou (Rangifer tarandus) displayed plasticity in movement and space-use behavior across a gradient of resource aggregation. We quantified first-passage time and range-use ratio as proxies for movement-related foraging behavior and examined how these traits varied at the individual level across a foraging resource gradient. Our results suggest that individuals adjusted first-passage time but not range-use ratio to maximize access to high-quality foraging resources. First-passage time was repeatable, and intercepts for first-passage time and range-use ratio were negatively correlated. Individuals matched first-passage time but not range-use ratio to the expectations of our patch-use model that maximized access to foraging resources, a result that suggests that individuals acclimated their movement patterns to accommodate both intra- and interannual variation in foraging resources on the landscape. Collectively, we highlight repeatable movement and space-use tactics and provide insight into how individual plasticity in movement interacts with landscape processes to affect the distribution of behavioral phenotypes and potentially fitness and population dynamics.},

The use of camera traps is a favourable and non-invasive method to study them. To observe natural behaviour, 60 camera traps were placed for three months in a state forest of 17.8 km2 in the region of the Luneburg Heath in northern Germany. In this area wild boar, roe deer, red deer, wolves and humans are common. The cameras recorded 20 s length video clips when animals passed the detection zone and could be triggered again immediately afterwards. In total 38 distinct behavioural elements were observed, which were assigned to one of seven behavioural categories. The occurrence of the behavioural categories per day was evaluated to compare their frequencies and see which are more essential than others. Generalised Additive Models were used to analyse the occurrence of each behaviour in relation to habitat and activity time. The results show that essential behavioural categories like foraging behaviour, locomotion and vigilance behaviour occurred more frequently than behaviour that “just” served for the well-being of wild boar. These three behavioural categories could be observed together mostly in the night in broad-leaved forests with a herb layer of 50–100\%, comfort behaviour occurred mostly at the ponds in coniferous forest. It is also observable that the behavioural categories foraging and comfort behaviour alternated several times during the night which offers the hypothesis that foraging is mostly followed by comfort behaviour. These findings pave the way towards implementing effective control strategies in the wild and animal welfare in captivity.},

	abstract = {Human–wildlife conflicts occur worldwide. Although many nonlethal mitigation solutions are available, they rarely use the behavioral ecology of the conflict species to derive effective and long-lasting solutions. Here, we use a long-term study with 106 GPS-collared free-ranging cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) to demonstrate how new insights into the socio-spatial organization of this species provide the key for such a solution. GPS-collared territory holders marked and defended communication hubs (CHs) in the core area of their territories. The CHs/territories were distributed in a regular pattern across the landscape such that they were not contiguous with each other but separated by a surrounding matrix. They were kept in this way by successive territory holders, thus maintaining this overdispersed distribution. The CHs were also visited by nonterritorial cheetah males and females for information exchange, thus forming hotspots of cheetah activity and presence. We hypothesized that the CHs pose an increased predation risk to young calves for cattle farmers in Namibia. In an experimental approach, farmers shifted cattle herds away from the CHs during the calving season. This drastically reduced their calf losses by cheetahs because cheetahs did not follow the herds but instead preyed on naturally occurring local wildlife prey in the CHs. This implies that in the cheetah system, there are “problem areas,” the CHs, rather than “problem individuals.” The incorporation of the behavioral ecology of conflict species opens promising areas to search for solutions in other conflict species with nonhomogenous space use.},

	abstract = {New tracking technologies are allowing researchers to study wildlife movements at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. Researchers now routinely deploy tracking sensors on multiple individual animals simultaneously, offering new opportunities to study the spatial-temporal interactions (often termed dynamic interaction) in the movements of these animals. The objective of this paper is to examine the statistical properties of a suite of currently available methods aimed at measuring spatial-temporal interactions and the ability of each method to characterize and capture different patterns of spatial-temporal interaction encountered in practice. Specifically, this paper examines issues relating to the spatial arrangement of interactions across a study area, temporal patterns in interactions over a tracking period, and the effectiveness of different statistical testing procedures used to identify significant spatial-temporal interaction. Simulations using biased correlated random walks are used to emulate different patterns of spatial-temporal interaction encountered in empirical data. The results demonstrate the challenges of statistical testing of interaction patterns with several methods having high rates of type I and/or type II error. More problematic is that, in practice, spatial-temporal interactions exhibit underlying spatial and/or temporal patterns, for example with key watering holes revisited daily, which can cause problems for statistics that use permutation tests from the original data to test for significance. The need to consider statistical significance in the context of biological significance, which relates to quantifying the spatial locations and temporal patterns of interaction events and types of interactions, is emphasized. Methods that can be adapted to facilitate spatial and temporally ‘local’ analysis are advantageous with high resolution tracking data currently being collected. An R package–wildlifeDI–provides the computational tools for performing the analysis described herein and is made openly available to other researchers.},

	abstract = {Spatial interactions can reveal the influence animals have on each other. In this context, ‘interaction’ refers to the joint occurrence in space (static interaction) or in both space and time (dynamic interaction). Most studies have focused on static interactions, estimated in terms of home range (HR) overlap. The few studies that have addressed dynamic interactions, corresponding to mutual attraction or avoidance within shared sections of animals' HRs, used statistical tests that assume independent relocations. Thus, although serial correlation in relocations provides invaluable information on space use dynamics, it has often been considered a statistical impairment. We developed a permutation test that explicitly takes serial correlation into account to test adequately whether two animals tend to move independently of each other, or show mutual attraction or avoidance, when moving in shared HR sections. We applied this novel method to 55 GPS-collared free-ranging lions, Panthera leo, in Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe), for which we also investigated static interactions by computing activity-weighted (i.e. using utilization distribution) HR overlap. Overlapping HRs were not at all uncommon for lions from different social groups. Within shared HR sections, individuals that tended to move jointly were often related. We found only one case of avoidance, involving two males, suggesting that when male lions, even unrelated ones, moved within a shared HR section, they generally did so independently of each other. Potentially competing males usually appeared to show avoidance by establishing HRs sufficiently far apart to allow for only marginal overlap, with only males tolerant of each other sharing sections of their HRs. Our results show that the simultaneous study of static and dynamic interactions can provide a comprehensive view of how space/time sharing with conspecifics influences animal movements and space use.},

	abstract = {Understanding how key parameters (e.g., density, range-size, and configuration) can affect animal movement remains a major goal of population ecology. This is particularly important for wildlife disease hosts, such as the European badger Meles meles, a reservoir of Mycobacterium bovis. Here we show how movements of 463 individuals among 223 inferred group territories across 755 km2 in Ireland were affected by sex, age, past-movement history, group composition, and group size index from 2009 to 2012. Females exhibited a greater probability of moving into groups with a male-biased composition, but male movements into groups were not associated with group composition. Male badgers were, however, more likely to make visits into territories than females. Animals that had immigrated into a territory previously were more likely to emigrate in the future. Animals exhibiting such “itinerant” movement patterns were more likely to belong to younger age classes. Inter-territorial movement propensity was negatively associated with group size, indicating that larger groups were more stable and less attractive (or permeable) to immigrants. Across the landscape, there was substantial variation in inferred territory-size and movement dynamics, which was related to group size. This represents behavioral plasticity previously only reported at the scale of the species’ biogeographical range. Our results highlight how a “one-size-fits-all” explanation of badger movement is likely to fail under varying ecological contexts and scales, with implications for bovine tuberculosis management.},

We investigated the dynamics of group formation in a population of roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, living in open cultivated plain. Our results show the high spontaneous instability of groups. The probability of fission per unit time increased approximately as the square of group size, and the sizes of the groups resulting from a splitting-up followed a uniform distribution. Attraction between groups was the main cause of fusion and was at work over distances of more than 200m, far exceeding the perception radius of roe deer in forest. In addition, when not yet separated by than more than 200m, two groups resulting from a single splitting-up had a high probability of remerging and restoring the parent group. Our results are thus consistent with the assumption that in large herbivores group size increases with habitat openness, not because of a change in individual's behaviour, but because groups are unstable and any increase of the distance at which animals perceive one another enhances the rate at which groups merge.},

Preferential relationships with relatives lead to the emergence of kin structures in the social system. Cohesive social groups of related individuals and female philopatry of wild boar create conditions for cooperation through kin selection and make the species a good biological model for studying kin structures. Yet, the role of kinship in shaping the social structure of wild boar populations is still poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated spatio-temporal patterns of associations and the social network structure of the wild boar Sus scrofa population in Białowieża National Park, Poland, which offered a unique opportunity to understand wild boar social interactions away from anthropogenic factors. We used a combination of telemetry data and genetic information to examine the impact of kinship on network cohesion and the strength of social bonds. Relatedness and spatial proximity between individuals were positively related to the strength of social bond. Consequently, the social network was spatially and genetically structured with well-defined and cohesive social units. However, spatial proximity between individuals could not entirely explain the association patterns and network structure. Genuine, kin-targeted, and temporarily stable relationships of females extended beyond spatial proximity between individuals while males interactions were short-lived and not shaped by relatedness. The findings of this study confirm the matrilineal nature of wild boar social structure and show how social preferences of individuals translate into an emergent socio-genetic population structure.},

The population was more active during the summer, and the mean group size (4.14 ± 0.21) was quite similar to other European boar group sizes. We confirmed that video traps are an appropriate method to monitor versatile wildlife, especially for assessing the population structure, sex and age ratios of wild boars.},

	abstract = {Inter-individual contacts in wildlife populations are usually highly heterogeneous. This variation translates into differential disease transmission rates between individuals, which have vital consequences for the spread, persistence, and control of infectious diseases. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) is an abundant game species across Europe that poses serious health threats to wildlife, livestock, and humans. However, factors shaping contact rates and structure in wild boar populations, key parameters in disease ecology, remain poorly studied. We quantified dyadic association rates, as a proxy of contacts, and individual-based network centrality measures using telemetry data from 3 wild boar populations across Europe. Next, we examined the effect of sex, age, group membership, and space use on association rates and individual centrality. Contact rates depended strongly on the distance between individual home ranges; the most frequent associations occurred at distances of 0–1 km (mostly within groups), less frequent at 1–3 km (mostly between groups), and sporadic at {\textgreater}4 km. Association rates were an order of magnitude higher within social groups than between them. Between-group association rates were only dependent on the distance between groups, with no apparent effect of animal sex or age. At the social network level, young animals (0.5–2 yr) showed greater between-group connectivity and a more central position in the network than adults. Our results highlight substantial contact heterogeneities in wild boar populations, which should be considered in epidemiological modeling and disease control actions. First, wild boar contact rates are strongly constrained socially and spatially. Hence, management measures reducing these constraints, such as supplementary feeding and intensive hunting, may lead to increased disease transmission rates. Second, young wild boars show exceptional connectivity within the population, highlighting their high capacity for disease transmission. Therefore, targeted removal of yearlings should be considered to optimize disease control efforts. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Animals living at high population densities commonly experience greater exposure to disease, leading to increased parasite burdens. However, social animals can benefit immunologically and hygienically from cooperation, and individuals may alter their socio-spatial behaviour in response to infection, both of which could counteract density-related increases in exposure. Consequently, the costs and benefits of sociality for disease are often uncertain. Here, we use a long-term study of a wild European badger population (Meles meles) to investigate how within-population variation in host density determines infection with multiple parasites. Four out of five parasite taxa exhibited consistent spatial hotspots of infection, which peaked among badgers living in areas of low local population density. Combined movement, survival, spatial and social network analyses revealed that parasite avoidance was the likely cause of this negative density dependence, with possible roles for localized mortality, encounter-dilution effects, and micronutrient-enhanced immunity. These findings demonstrate that animals can organize their societies in space to minimize parasite infection, with important implications for badger behavioural ecology and for the control of badger-associated diseases.},

	abstract = {The frequency of group fission and fusion is critical for understanding the evolution of sociality, as it measures group cohesiveness, which can confer a high fitness value on individuals who practice it. Variations in the frequency of fission and fusion can also reveal an individual’s response to environmental changes. As fission–fusion group dynamics influence the risk of disease transmission, measuring it accurately may have implications for population management. Here, we extend a method to assess the frequency of fission and fusion from continuous monitoring of group composition. The former method was based on the variation in group size (i.e., party/subgroup size) within which marked individuals were successively recorded. Upon validation of the method here, we propose a correction, using the coefficient of variation in group size instead of the variation in group size. We performed our study on an enclosed herd of reindeer, Rangifer tarandus. All reindeer were tracked using Global Positioning System (GPS) collars and followed by direct observations. GPS collars allowed us to obtain accurate measures of the frequency of fission and fusion that we used to validate our models. The resulting method best described the temporal variation in fission and fusion frequency without the confounding effect of the variation in group size. This method can easily be applied to other populations where some individuals can be recognized and their group size repeatedly recorded. It will also help in quantifying the 2nd dimension of the fission–fusion group dynamics: the variation in group size.},

	abstract = {Statistical modelling of animal movement data is a rapidly growing area of research. Typically though, these models have been developed for analysing the tracks of individual animals and we lose sight of the impact animals have on each other with regards to their movement behaviours. We aim to develop a model with a flexible social framework that allows us to capture that information. Our approach is based on the concept of social hierarchies, and this is embedded in a multivariate diffusion process which models the movement of a group of animals. The possibility of switching between behavioural states facilitates dynamic social behaviours and we augment the observed data with sampled state switching times in order to model the animals' behaviour naturally in continuous time. In addition, this enables us to carry out exact inference in a Bayesian setting with the benefits of being able to handle regular, irregular and missing data. All movement and behaviour parameters are estimated with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We examine the capability of our model with simulated data before fitting it to GPS locations of five wild olive baboons Papio anubis. The results enable us to identify which animals are influencing the movement of others and when, which provides both a dynamic and long-term static insight into the group's social behaviours. Our model offers a flexible method in continuous time with which to model the network of social interactions within animal movement. Doing so avoids the limitations caused by a discrete-time approach and it allows us to capture rich information with regards to a group's social structure, leading to constructive applications in conservation and management decisions. However, currently it is a computationally expensive task to fit the model to data, which in turns limits extending the model to more fruitful but complex cases such as heterogeneity in space or individual characteristics. Furthermore, our social hierarchy approach assumes all relevant animals are tracked and that any interactions have some ordering, both of which narrow the scope within which this approach is appropriate.},

Yet, little is known about the factors shaping contact networks in many wildlife species and how wildlife management actions might affect contact networks. Wild pigs in North America are an invasive, socially-structured species that pose a health concern for domestic swine given their ability to transmit numerous devastating diseases such as African swine fever (ASF). Using proximity loggers and GPS data from 48 wild pigs in Florida and South Carolina, USA, we employed a probabilistic framework to estimate weighted contact networks. We determined the effects of sex, social group, and spatial distribution (monthly home range overlap and distance) on wild pig contact. We also estimated the impacts of management-induced perturbations on contact and inferred their effects on ASF establishment in wild pigs with simulation. Social group membership was the primary factor influencing contacts. Between-group contacts depended primarily on space use characteristics, with fewer contacts among groups separated by {\textgreater}2 km and no contacts among groups {\textgreater}4 km apart within a month. Modeling ASF dynamics on the contact network demonstrated that indirect contacts resulting from baiting (a typical method of attracting wild pigs or game species to a site to enhance recreational hunting) increased the risk of disease establishment by 33\% relative to direct contact. Low-intensity population reduction ({\textless}5.9\% of the population) had no detectable impact on contact structure but reduced predicted ASF establishment risk relative to no population reduction. We demonstrate an approach for understanding the relative role of spatial, social, and individual-level characteristics in shaping contact networks and predicting their effects on disease establishment risk, thus providing insight for optimizing disease control in spatially- and socially-structured wildlife species.},

However, as trade-offs between sensor cost, battery life and sensor weight have to be made, GPS based studies scheduling long data collection periods and including a high number of animals, have to deal with problems like high hardware costs and data disruption during recharging of sensors. Furthermore, human\&ndash;animal interaction due to sensor changing at the end of battery life interferes with the animal behaviour under analysis. The present study thus proposes a setting to deal with these challenges and offers the software tool \&ldquo;HerdGPS-Preprocessor\&rdquo;, because collecting position data from multiple animals nonstop for several weeks produces a high amount of raw data which needs to be sorted, preprocessed and provided in a suitable format per animal and day. The software tool \&ldquo;HerdGPS-Preprocessor\&rdquo; additionally outputs contact lists to enable a straight analysis of animal contacts. The software tool was exemplarily deployed for one month of daily and continuous GPS data of 40 horses in a loose-housing boarding facility in northern Germany. Contact lists were used to generate separate networks for every hour, which are then analysed with regard to the network parameter density, diameter and clique structure. Differences depending on the day and the day time could be observed. More dense networks with more and larger cliques were determined in the hours prior to the opening of additional pasture.},

	abstract = {Animals lead rich social lives. They care for one another, compete for resources, and mate. Within a society, social relationships may be simple or complex and usually vary considerably, both between different groups of individuals and over time. These social systems are fundamental to biological organization, and animal societies are central to studies of behavioral and evolutionary biology. But how do we study animal societies?  How do we take observations of animals fighting, grooming, or forming groups and produce a realistic description or model of their societies?Analyzing AnimalSocieties presents a conceptual framework for analyzing social behavior and demonstrates how to put this framework into practice by collecting suitable data on the interactions and associations of individuals so that relationships can be described, and, from these, models can be derived.  In addition to presenting the tools, Hal Whitehead illustrates their applicability using a wide range of real data on a variety of animal species—from bats and chimps to dolphins and birds. The techniques that Whitehead describes will be profitably adopted by scientists working with primates, cetaceans, birds, and ungulates, but the tools can be used to study societies of invertebrates, amphibians, and even humans. Analyzing AnimalSocieties will become a standard reference for those studying vertebrate social behavior and will give to these studies the kind of quality standard already in use in other areas of the life sciences.},

	abstract = {Statistical modelling of animal movement data is a rapidly growing area of research. Typically though, these models have been developed for analysing the tracks of individual animals and we lose sight of the impact animals have on each other with regards to their movement behaviours. We aim to develop a model with a flexible social framework that allows us to capture that information. Our approach is based on the concept of social hierarchies, and this is embedded in a multivariate diffusion process which models the movement of a group of animals. The possibility of switching between behavioural states facilitates dynamic social behaviours and we augment the observed data with sampled state switching times in order to model the animals' behaviour naturally in continuous time. In addition, this enables us to carry out exact inference in a Bayesian setting with the benefits of being able to handle regular, irregular and missing data. All movement and behaviour parameters are estimated with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We examine the capability of our model with simulated data before fitting it to GPS locations of five wild olive baboons Papio anubis. The results enable us to identify which animals are influencing the movement of others and when, which provides both a dynamic and long-term static insight into the group's social behaviours. Our model offers a flexible method in continuous time with which to model the network of social interactions within animal movement. Doing so avoids the limitations caused by a discrete-time approach and it allows us to capture rich information with regards to a group's social structure, leading to constructive applications in conservation and management decisions. However, currently it is a computationally expensive task to fit the model to data, which in turns limits extending the model to more fruitful but complex cases such as heterogeneity in space or individual characteristics. Furthermore, our social hierarchy approach assumes all relevant animals are tracked and that any interactions have some ordering, both of which narrow the scope within which this approach is appropriate.},

However, estimates of contact between animals are notoriously difficult to acquire. Researchers commonly use telemetry technologies to identify animal associations, but such data may have different sampling intervals and often captures a small subset of the population. The objectives of this study were to outline best practices for telemetry sampling in network studies of infectious disease by determining (a) the consequences of telemetry sampling on our ability to estimate network structure, (b) whether contact networks can be approximated using purely spatial contact definitions and (c) how wildlife spatial configurations may influence telemetry sampling requirements. We simulated individual movement trajectories for wildlife populations using a home range-like movement model, creating full location datasets and corresponding ‘complete’ networks. To mimic telemetry data, we created ‘sample’ networks by subsampling the population (10\%–100\% of individuals) with a range of sampling intervals (every minute to every 3 days). We varied the definition of contact for sample networks, using either spatiotemporal or spatial overlap, and varied the spatial configuration of populations (random, lattice or clustered). To compare complete and sample networks, we calculated seven network metrics important for disease transmission and assessed mean ranked correlation coefficients and percent error between complete and sample network metrics. Telemetry sampling severely reduced our ability to calculate global node-level network metrics, but had less impact on local and network-level metrics. Even so, in populations with infrequent associations, high intensity telemetry sampling may still be necessary. Defining contact in terms of spatial overlap generally resulted in overly connected networks, but in some instances, could compensate for otherwise coarse telemetry data. By synthesizing movement and disease ecology with computational approaches, we characterized trade-offs important for using wildlife telemetry data beyond ecological studies of individual movement, and found that careful use of telemetry data has the potential to inform network models. Thus, with informed application of telemetry data, we can make significant advances in leveraging its use for a better understanding and management of wildlife infectious disease.},

	abstract = {Animal social network analysis (SNA) often uses proximity data obtained from automated tracking of individuals. Identifying associations based on proximity requires deciding on quantitative criteria such as the maximum distance or the longest time interval between visits of different individuals to still consider them associated. These quantitative criteria are not easily chosen based on a priori biological arguments alone. Here we propose a procedure for optimizing proximity-based association criteria in SNA, whereby different spatial and temporal criteria are screened to determine which combination detects more network structure. If we assume that biologically relevant associations among individuals are non-random, and that proximity data are mostly influenced by those associations, then it is logical to select criteria that minimise random associations and show the underlying network structure more clearly. We first used simulations to evaluate which of four simple descriptors of network structure remain unbiased (i.e. do not change directionally) when reducing the number of observations, since unbiased descriptors are necessary for comparing the structure of networks using different association criteria. Then, using two of those descriptors (coefficient of variation of the strength of associations and network entropy) and empirical proximity data from automated tracking of common waxbills Estrilda astrild in a mesocosm environment, we found that the structure-based optimization procedure selected the most biologically relevant combination of spatial and temporal proximity criteria, in the sense that those criteria were also the best at distinguishing between previously known social subgroups of individuals. These results indicate that, provided that the assumptions for structure-based optimization are met, this procedure can find the most biologically relevant association criteria. Thus, under the condition that proximity data are shaped by non-random social associations, and if using adequate descriptors of network structure, structure-based optimization may be a useful tool for SNA, particularly when a priori biological arguments are insufficient to inform the choice of proximity-based association criteria.},

	abstract = {Animal social networks are often used to describe dynamic social systems, where individual behaviour generates network-level structures that subsequently influence individual-level behaviour. This interdependence between individual behaviour and group structuring is of central concern for questions concerning the evolution and development of social systems and collective animal behaviour more generally. Various statistical methods exist for estimating network changes through time. One approach, time-aggregated networks, takes repeated snapshots of interactions within windows of time to generate a time series of networks. However, there remain many analytical hurdles when implementing the time-aggregated approach. To ameliorate this, we introduce an r package netTS that focuses on three analytical steps for analysing time-aggregated networks: choosing appropriate time scale using bootstrapping, comparing patterns to relevant null models using permutation and finally building and interpreting statistical models using simulated data. We use simulated data to first highlight these steps, then use observed grooming data from a group of vervet monkeys as an applied example. Our results suggest that the use of bootstrapping and permutation can accurately extract known patterns from simulated data. Using this approach with vervet data suggests that there is consistent social structuring, differing from what would be expected due to chance, and that some individuals are contributing to this structure more than others (i.e. keystone individuals). We demonstrate that bootstrapping, permutation and simulation can aid in constructing and interpreting time-aggregated networks. We suggest that the use of time-aggregated networks to quantify patterns of network change can be a useful tool alongside process-based approaches that seek mechanistic descriptions. Ultimately, by looking at both patterns and processes, dynamic networks can be used to better understand how individual behaviour generates social structures, and in turn how individual behaviour can be influenced by social structures, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the evolution of social behaviour.},

Persistence probability was near 0 for the FMDV-like case under a wide range of parameter values and contact structures, while persistence was probable for the CSFV-like case. There were no sets of conditions where the FMDV-like pathogen persisted in every stochastic simulation. Even when population growth rates were up to 300\% annually, the FMDV-like pathogen persisted in {\textless}25\% of simulations regardless of transmission probabilities and contact structure. For networks and spatial contact structure, persistence probability of the FMDV-like pathogen was always {\textless}10\%. Because of its low persistence probability, even very early response to the FMDV-like pathogen in feral swine was unwarranted while response to the CSFV-like pathogen was generally effective. When pre-emergence culling of feral swine caused population declines, it was effective at decreasing outbreak size of both diseases by ≥80\%.},

	abstract = {The importance of social stability and its influence on the expression of the social behaviour repertoire in domestic animals remains poorly understood, especially for affiliative behaviours and other putative socio-positive behaviours such as social play. This study investigated the occurrence and type of social behaviours, with a focus on socio-positive behaviours, and their relation to growth and welfare indicators within groups of littermates vs. groups composed of pigs from several litters and initially unfamiliar to each other. We hypothesised that pigs kept with littermates would show more positive social interactions than pigs socially mixed after weaning, and that social interactions would change over time as mixed groups progressively regained social stability. The behaviour of 14 groups of indoor-housed weaned pigs (7 groups per treatment; 8–14 pigs per group) was observed from the day after weaning (4 weeks of age) and thereafter once per week until the seventh week using scan sampling (48 scans per individual per day) and continuous observations (30 min per group per day). Pigs spent most time lying together (on average 50 \% of the scans) or performing non-social behaviours (31 \% of scans). Exploring together was the most common social activity, observed in 7.32 \% of scans. Other social behaviours occurred infrequently and each accounted for only 0.04\%–1.09\% of scans. Treatment significantly influenced mounting behaviour, with more mounting between pigs in the mixed groups as compared to littermate groups (0.52 \% vs. 0.27 \% of scans, respectively; P = 0.03). Other behaviours did not differ between treatments or the interaction of treatment and day. Nosing proximity, social play, exploring together, and oral manipulation of conspecifics varied between days (i.e. age; all P {\textless} 0.01). Pigs in littermate groups showed a better growth rate over the seven days after weaning (littermates: 1.03 ± 0.11 kg vs. mixed: 0.78 ± 0.11 kg; P = 0.01). In conclusion, socio-positive behaviours were more prevalent than socio-negative behaviours overall, supporting that positive social interactions may be an important but overlooked aspect of social life. Groups of littermates did not show more positive social behaviour than mixed groups, but they did show less mounting behaviour and seemed less affected by the stress caused by weaning.},

	abstract = {Understanding how key parameters (e.g., density, range-size, and configuration) can affect animal movement remains a major goal of population ecology. This is particularly important for wildlife disease hosts, such as the European badger Meles meles, a reservoir of Mycobacterium bovis. Here we show how movements of 463 individuals among 223 inferred group territories across 755 km2 in Ireland were affected by sex, age, past-movement history, group composition, and group size index from 2009 to 2012. Females exhibited a greater probability of moving into groups with a male-biased composition, but male movements into groups were not associated with group composition. Male badgers were, however, more likely to make visits into territories than females. Animals that had immigrated into a territory previously were more likely to emigrate in the future. Animals exhibiting such "itinerant" movement patterns were more likely to belong to younger age classes. Inter-territorial movement propensity was negatively associated with group size, indicating that larger groups were more stable and less attractive (or permeable) to immigrants. Across the landscape, there was substantial variation in inferred territory-size and movement dynamics, which was related to group size. This represents behavioral plasticity previously only reported at the scale of the species' biogeographical range. Our results highlight how a "one-size-fits-all" explanation of badger movement is likely to fail under varying ecological contexts and scales, with implications for bovine tuberculosis management.},

Similarity of behavioural dendrograms to genetic dendrograms indicated that genetic relationships of feral pigs played a role in observed population structure. A single discrepancy between genetic and behavioural dendrograms suggested two animals dispersed to an adjacent sounder. Also, one sounder appeared to have been created by fission from a larger, adjacent sounder.

	abstract = {In the past decade, ecologists have witnessed vast improvements in our ability to collect animal movement data through animal-borne technology, such as through GPS or ARGOS systems. However, more data does not necessarily yield greater knowledge in understanding animal ecology and conservation. In this paper, we provide a review of the major benefits, problems and potential misuses of GPS/Argos technology to animal ecology and conservation. Benefits are obvious, and include the ability to collect fine-scale spatio-temporal location data on many previously impossible to study animals, such as ocean-going fish, migratory songbirds and long-distance migratory mammals. These benefits come with significant problems, however, imposed by frequent collar failures and high cost, which often results in weaker study design, reduced sample sizes and poorer statistical inference. In addition, we see the divorcing of biologists from a field-based understanding of animal ecology to be a growing problem. Despite these difficulties, GPS devices have provided significant benefits, particularly in the conservation and ecology of wide-ranging species. We conclude by offering suggestions for ecologists on which kinds of ecological questions would currently benefit the most from GPS/Argos technology, and where the technology has been potentially misused. Significant conceptual challenges remain, however, including the links between movement and behaviour, and movement and population dynamics.},

In total, 120 wild boars of different sexes and age classes were captured and monitored from 2002 to 2006. All of them were genetically analyzed by using 10 polymorphic microsatellites (HE = 0.693, k = 6.6) and a matrix of pairwise relatedness was calculated. In addition, a reference sample of fully related individuals was created by genotyping 11 adult females and their fetuses (n = 56). Spatial data were gathered for 65 animals that had been fitted with either radiocollars or ear transmitters. Sixteen social units were identified by capture data and confirmed by observations and telemetry. A correlation between interindividual spatial distance and relatedness was observed only in summer–early autumn and seemed to be associated to the presence of piglets. The prediction of matrilinearity in wild boar social units was not confirmed, because a low degree of relatedness among boars was observed within groups. Aggregations of unrelated adult females (with their litters) were detected in the study population. The high turnover in the population due to human-caused mortality seems to be the main factor responsible for this altered social structure. Accordingly, we suggest that the observed social organization would result from grouping of unrelated survivors that is promoted by the presence of wolves in the area.},

Yet, the impacts of social processes on spatial spread remain poorly understood and estimates of spatial transmission kernels (STKs) often exclude social structure. Understanding the impacts of social structure on STKs is important for obtaining robust inferences for policy decisions and optimizing response plans. We fit spatially explicit transmission models with different assumptions about contact structure to African swine fever virus surveillance data from eastern Poland from 2014 to 2015 and evaluated how social structure affected inference of STKs and spatial spread. The model with social structure provided better inference of spatial spread, predicted that approximately 80\% of transmission events occurred within family groups, and that transmission was weakly female-biased (other models predicted weakly male-biased transmission). In all models, most transmission events were within 1.5 km, with some rare events at longer distances. Effective reproductive numbers were between 1.1 and 2.5 (maximum values between 4 and 8). Social structure can modify spatial transmission dynamics. Accounting for this additional contact heterogeneity in spatial transmission models could provide more robust inferences of STKs for policy decisions, identify best control targets and improve transparency in model uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Behaviour is the interface between an organism and its environment, and behavioural plasticity is important for organisms to cope with environmental change. Social behaviour is particularly important because sociality is a dynamic process, where environmental variation influences group dynamics and social plasticity can mediate resource acquisition. Heterogeneity in the ecological environment can therefore influence the social environment. The combination of the ecological and social environments may be interpreted collectively as the “socioecological environment,” which could explain variation in fitness. Our objective was to outline a framework through which individual social and spatial phenotypes can be integrated and interpreted as phenotypes that covary as a function of changes in the socioecological environment. We propose the socioecological environment is composed of individual behavioural traits, including sociality and habitat selection, both of which are repeatable, potentially heritable and may reflect animal personality traits. We also highlight how ecological and social niche theory can be applied to the socioecological environment framework, where individuals occupy different socioecological niches. Individual sociality and habitat selection are also density-dependent, and theory predicts that density-dependent traits should affect reproduction, survival, and therefore fitness and population dynamics. We then illustrate the proximate links between sociality, habitat selection and fitness as well as the ultimate, and possibly adaptive, consequences associated with changes in population density. The ecological, evolutionary and applied implications of our proposed socioecological environment framework are broad and changes in density could influence individual fitness and population dynamics. For instance, human-induced environmental changes can influence population density, which can affect the distribution of social and spatial phenotypes within a population. In summary, we outline a conceptual framework that incorporates individual social and spatial behavioural traits with fitness and we highlight a range of ecological and evolutionary processes that are likely associated with the socioecological environment.},

Population structuring and spatial behaviour are key determinants of individuals’ observed social behaviour, but quantifying these spatial components alongside multiple other drivers remains difficult due to data scarcity and analytical complexity. We used a 43-year dataset detailing a wild red deer population to investigate how individuals’ spatial behaviours drive social network positioning, while simultaneously assessing other potential contributing factors. Using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) multi-matrix animal models, we demonstrate that social network positions are shaped by two-dimensional landscape locations, pairwise space sharing, individual range size, and spatial and temporal variation in population density, alongside smaller but detectable impacts of a selection of individual-level phenotypic traits. These results indicate strong, multifaceted spatiotemporal structuring in this society, emphasising the importance of considering multiple spatial components when investigating the causes and consequences of sociality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Authorship Statement{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}GFA conceived the study, analysed the data, and wrote the manuscript, advised by JAF.

The degree of intraspecific variation in fission–fusion dynamics across the geographical range is poorly known. During 2008–2016, 38 adult female Cape buffalo were equipped with GPS collars in three populations located in different protected areas (Gonarezhou National Park and Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe; Kruger National Park, South Africa) to investigate the patterns and environmental drivers of fission–fusion dynamics among populations. We estimated home range overlap and fission and fusion events between Cape buffalo dyads. We investigated the temporal dynamics of both events at daily and seasonal scales and examined the influence of habitat and distance to water on event location. Fission–fusion dynamics were generally consistent across populations: Fission and fusion periods lasted on average between less than one day and three days. However, we found seasonal differences in the underlying patterns of fission and fusion, which point out the likely influence of resource availability and distribution in time on group dynamics: During the wet season, Cape buffalo split and associated more frequently and were in the same or in a different subgroup for shorter periods. Cape buffalo subgroups were more likely to merge than to split in open areas located near water, but overall vegetation and distance to water were very poor predictors of where fission and fusion events occurred. This study is one of the first to quantify fission–fusion dynamics in a single species across several populations with a common methodology, thus robustly questioning the behavioral flexibility of fission–fusion dynamics among environments.},

	abstract = {Foundational work has examined adaptive social behavior in animals in relation to the costs and benefits of group living. Within this context, a “group” of animals represents an organizational unit that is integral to the study of animal ecology and evolution. Definitions of animal group sizes are often subjective with considerable variability within and across species. However, investigations of both the extent and implications of such variability in the estimation of animal group sizes are currently lacking. Selecting ungulates as a case study, we conducted a literature review to assess prevailing practices used to determine group sizes among terrestrial Cetartiodactyla and Perissodactyla. Via this process, we examined group size definitions for 61 species across 171 peer-reviewed studies published between 1962 and 2018. These studies quantified group sizes via estimation of ungulate aggregations in space and time. Spatial estimates included a nearest neighbor distance ranging from 1.4 m to 1,000 m, and this variation was partially explained by a weak positive correlation ({\textbar}r{\textbar} = .4, p {\textless} .003) with the body size of the ungulate research subjects. The temporal extent over which group size was estimated was even broader, ranging from three minutes to 24 hr. The considerable variability in ungulate group size estimation that we observed complicates efforts to not only compare and replicate studies but also to evaluate underlying theories of group living. We recommend that researchers: (a) clearly describe the spatiotemporal extents over which they define ungulate group sizes, (b) highlight foundational empirical and ecological rationale for these extents, and (c) seek to align such extents among individual species so as to facilitate cross-system comparisons of ungulate group size dynamics. We believe an integrative approach to ungulate group size estimation would readily facilitate replication, comparability, and evaluation of competing hypotheses examining the tradeoffs of animal sociality.},

In fission–fusion animal societies, individuals rarely have the same level of information about their environment, with knowledge being a reflection of past individual and collective decisions. Knowledge of the environment is particularly essential in heterogeneous landscapes, where resources may vary in space and time. Indeed, landscape heterogeneity, a product of the quantity and configuration of resources as well as predators and competitors, is the basis of both individual and collective movement decisions. We assessed individual movement decisions of an alpine ungulate as a function of landscape knowledge and landscape heterogeneity. We hypothesized that individuals would base their decisions on previous information in areas they know well, especially in highly heterogeneous landscapes. These individual decisions would have consequences for the collective movement decisions of groups. To test this hypothesis, we used GPS collars to monitor the movements of ∼45\% of the individuals (N=28) of a small population of woodland caribou, Rangifer tarandus caribou, between 2013 and 2016. We assessed the fission probability of caribou dyads (N=3681, from 172 dyad combinations) in relation to landscape knowledge, landscape heterogeneity and social bonds between dyad members. The probability of group fission was influenced by the interaction between the variables describing landscape knowledge of dyadic members and social bonds. The probability of group fission and the influence of habitat or social bonds on fission probability increased with landscape knowledge. In familiar landscapes, individuals were more likely to stay with conspecifics if they shared a strong social bond or if they were in preferential habitat. Such fine adjustments in movement and social decisions demonstrated the importance of the information held by conspecifics when occupying unfamiliar areas. By staying with conspecifics, individuals could gain access to high-quality resources without the energetic cost of locating such resources.},

	abstract = {Social network analyses allow researchers to describe patterns of social interactions and their consequences in animal societies. Since direct observations in natural settings are often difficult, researchers often use tracking technologies to build proximity-based social networks. However, because both social behaviour (e.g. conspecific attraction) and environmental heterogeneity (e.g. resources attracting individuals independently) affect rates of interaction, identifying the processes that shape social networks is challenging. We tracked sleepy lizards, Tiliqua rugosa, using global positioning system (GPS) telemetry to investigate whether they show conspecific attraction or avoidance beyond any shared space use driven by environmental heterogeneity. Since these lizards have strong pair bonds and nonoverlapping core home ranges, we predicted different interaction rates between inter- and intrasex dyads and compared social network indices among dyad types (male–male, female–female and intersex) using node-identity permutation tests. We also mapped interactions onto the home ranges (using distance from the centre as an index) and contrasted observed social networks with those expected from a spatially explicit null model. We found that dyad types differed in their interaction patterns. Intersex dyads had stronger connections (higher edge weight) than a null expectation, and stronger than for same-sex dyads. Same-sex dyads did not differ in edge weight from the null expectation, but were significantly more common (higher degree). Males had larger home ranges than females and consequently male–male dyads interacted further away from their home range centres. Moreover, the locations of these interactions also differed from the null expectations more strongly than other dyad types. Hence, we conclude that males predominantly interacted with each other at the peripheries of their home range, presumably reflecting territorial behaviour. By applying a novel analysis technique, we accounted for the nonsocial component of space use and revealed sex-specific interaction patterns and the contribution of conspecific attraction to the social structure in this species. More generally we report how mapping the locations of nonrandom interaction rates provides broad information on the behaviours they represent.},

	abstract = {Wildlife aggregation patterns can influence disease transmission. However, limited research evaluates the influence of anthropogenic and natural factors on aggregation. Many managers would like to reduce wildlife contact rates, driven by aggregation, to limit disease transmission. We develop a novel analytical framework to quantify how management activities such as supplemental feeding and hunting versus weather drive contact rates while accounting for correlated contacts. We apply the framework to the National Elk Refuge (NER), Wyoming, USA, where the probable arrival of chronic wasting disease (CWD) has magnified concerns. We used a daily proximity index to measure contact rates among 68 global positioning system collared elk from 2016 to 2019. We modelled contact rates as a function of abiotic weather-related effects, anthropogenic effects and aggregation from the prior day. The winter of 2017–2018 had greater natural forage availability and little snow, which led to a rare non-feeding year on the NER and provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the effect of feeding on contact rates relative to other conditions. Supplemental feeding was the strongest predictor of aggregation, and contact rates were 2.6 times larger while feeding occurred compared to the baseline rate (0.34 and 0.13, respectively). Snow-covered area was the second strongest predictor of contact rates highlighting the importance of abiotic factors to elk aggregation, but this effect had half the strength of feeding. These results are the first to show, even in animals that congregate naturally, how greatly supplemental feeding amplifies aggregation. Contact rates were also 23\% lower during times when elk hunting was active (0.10) compared to the baseline. Synthesis and applications. Supplemental feeding increased contacts between elk well above the natural effects of weather, even after accounting for correlated movement expected in wintering ungulates. Similarly, differences in hunting season timing with adjacent areas led to an increase in contacts, suggesting an additional management option for reducing aggregation. The analytical framework presented supports the evaluation of temporally varying management actions that influence aggregation broadly and can be easily implemented whether the interest in changing aggregation is related to reduction of disease transmission, human–wildlife conflict or inter-species competition.},

These dynamics have major implications at both population and individual levels, exerting an important influence on patterns of social behaviour, information transfer and epidemiology. However, fission–fusion dynamics in birds have received relatively little attention. We review the existing evidence for fission–fusion sociality in birds alongside a more general explanation of the social and ecological processes that may drive fission–fusion dynamics. Through a combination of recent methodological developments and novel technologies with well-established areas of ornithological research, avian systems offer great potential to further our understanding of fission–fusion social systems and the consequences they have at an individual and population level. In particular, investigating the interaction between social structure and environmental covariates can promote a deeper understanding of the evolution of social behaviour and the adaptive value of group living, as well as having important consequences for applied research.},

Little is known about birds, even though some species like ravens have recently received attention for their socio-cognitive skills and use of social bonds. While raven breeders defend territories year-round, non-breeders roam through large areas and form groups at food sources or night roosts. We here examined the fission-fusion patterns of non-breeding ravens over years, investigating whether birds meet repeatedly either at the same or at different locations. We combined four large datasets: presence-absence observations from two study sites (Austria, Italy) and GPS-tracking of ravens across two study areas (Austria, France). As expected, we found a highly dynamic system in which individuals with long phases of temporary settlement had a high probability of meeting others. Although GPS-tagged ravens spread out over thousands of square kilometres, we found repeated associations between almost half of the possible combinations at different locations. Such a system makes repeated interactions between individuals at different sites possible and likely. High fission-fusion dynamics may thus not hinder but shape the social complexity of ravens and, possibly, other long-term bonded birds.},

	abstract = {In group-living animals, heterogeneity in individuals’ social connections may mediate the sharing of microbial infectious agents. In this regard, the genetic relatedness of individuals’ commensal gut bacterium Escherichia coli may be ideal to assess the potential for pathogen transmission through animal social networks. Here we use microbial phylogenetics and population genetics approaches, as well as host social network reconstruction, to assess evidence for the contact-mediated sharing of E. coli among three groups of captively housed rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), at multiple organizational scales. For each group, behavioral data on grooming, huddling, and aggressive interactions collected for a six-week period were used to reconstruct social network communities via the Data Cloud Geometry (DCG) clustering algorithm. Further, an E. coli isolate was biochemically confirmed and genotypically fingerprinted from fecal swabs collected from each macaque. Population genetics approaches revealed that Group Membership, in comparison to intrinsic attributes like age, sex, and/or matriline membership of individuals, accounted for the highest proportion of variance in E. coli genotypic similarity. Social network approaches revealed that such sharing was evident at the community-level rather than the dyadic level. Specifically, although we found no links between dyadic E. coli similarity and social contact frequencies, similarity was significantly greater among macaques within the same social network communities compared to those across different communities. Moreover, tests for one of our study-groups confirmed that E. coli isolated from macaque rectal swabs were more genotypically similar to each other than they were to isolates from environmentally deposited feces. In summary, our results suggest that among frequently interacting, spatially constrained macaques with complex social relationships, microbial sharing via fecal-oral, social contact-mediated routes may depend on both individuals’ direct connections and on secondary network pathways that define community structure. They lend support to the hypothesis that social network communities may act as bottlenecks to contain the spread of infectious agents, thereby encouraging disease control strategies to focus on multiple organizational scales. Future directions includeincreasing microbial sampling effort per individual to better-detect dyadic transmission events, and assessments of the co-evolutionary links between sociality, infectious agent risk, and host immune function.},

The drivers of such complex social dynamics are thought to relate to resource availability, density effects, and social interactions. During 2008–2009, we collared 15 Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) cows in different groups in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, to study social dynamics in a flood-pulsed ecosystem. Hierarchical clustering identified 2 subpopulations, 1 migratory and 1 resident. We calculated Utilization Distribution Overlap Index (UDOI) and number and duration of fusion events between buffalo dyads and related them to environmental variables. Number of fusion events and duration of fusion periods did not vary seasonally, total fusion time varied seasonally and annually, and UDOI varied with year and subpopulation. Fission events were more likely in cluttered habitats, but only in the late flood season. There was more open habitat in home range overlap (HRO) areas than home ranges (HR) in most seasons. Pan density in rainy season HROs was lower and higher than in HRs in 2008 and 2009, respectively, and in all flood seasons HRO areas were closer to permanent water than HRs, suggesting that fusion occurred when buffalo congregated on resources. Whereas previous studies described large herds that sometimes split, we identified numerous smaller groups that occasionally fused, indicating a very fluid social system. Our results highlight the need to understand social system flexibility to ensure appropriate management and understand the varying impacts of environmental and anthropogenic effects on subpopulations within the same geographic area.},

To examine grouping-patterns of Japanese wild boars, the degree of association between any two individuals, based on coexisting time at the provisioning site, was analyzed for each study period. Mother and her litter group (MLG), female littermate group (FLG) and solitary individual were recognized grouping-patterns. Groups did not associate with each other. Male offspring separated from their mother before 1 year of age and become solitary. Separation of female offspring occurred before the subsequent parturition of their mother. The proximate cause of separation was increased aggression by the mother. After separation, female offspring formed a FLG. However, the FLG seemed to be generally a temporary one, maintaining its stability only until parturition of it's members. Thereafter adult females had no close association with any other individuals, except for their own infants. Male offspring disappeared from their natal area, while female offspring could remain there.},

	abstract = {Wild boar populations are strongly increasing across Europe. Although details of population dynamics and reproductive potential are known in this species, our knowledge about the social structure and a possible impact of hunting on this structure is poorly understood. Here we investigated the grouping behaviour of yearling wild boar females under enclosure housed conditions. All females were at the same age and older females (i.e., potential group leaders in a family group) were not present. The wild boar females were purchased at the age of six months from four different breeding sites. After a habituation period of ˜8 weeks the females were released randomly into two large enclosures, but ensuring that animals of different origin and body mass were evenly distributed. We analysed data from 111 female wild boars kept in two enclosures (enclosure east (EE): 72 females on ˜33 ha and enclosure west (EW): 39 females on ˜22 ha). Observations were carried out between March and August the year after birth (at the age of yearlings). The yearling females did not reproduce in the observation year. Data were analysed using social network analysis (SNA). We observed that the females formed stable groups during the study period. Group size did not differ significantly between the enclosures (group sizes between 16 and 20 individuals in the EE and between 11 and 17 individuals in the EW). Interestingly, the higher number of individuals lead to more instead of larger groups in the EE. Further, the group compositions were not based on the relatedness between the animals, as females from different breeding sites formed stable groups together. Rather, common habituation (familiarity) had a stronger effect on subsequent group formation. Within the groups we did not observe a linear hierarchy, although the groups were stable over time. Two females showed high betweenness values (i.e., an individual was often part of the shortest pathways in a network) compared with the average, indicating that females show differences in their connectivity within the social network of a population. Individuals with a high betweenness are very likely to rapidly spread diseases in a population and might play a key role in health management strategies.},

	abstract = {Mammalian societies represent many different types of social systems. While some aspects of social systems have been extensively studied, there is little consensus on how to conceptualize social organization across species. Here, we present a framework describing eight dimensions of social organization to capture its diversity across mammalian societies. The framework uses simple information that is clearly separated from the three other aspects of social systems: social structure, care system, and mating system. By applying our framework across 208 species of all mammalian taxa, we find a rich multidimensional landscape of social organization. Correlation analysis reveals that the dimensions have relatively high independence, suggesting that social systems are able to evolve different aspects of social behavior without being tied to particular traits. Applying a clustering algorithm allows us to identify the relative importance of key dimensions on patterns of social organization. Finally, mapping mating system onto these clusters shows that social organization represents a distinct aspect of social systems. In the future, this framework will aid reporting on important aspects of natural history in species and facilitate comparative analyses, which ultimately will provide the ability to generate new insights into the primary drivers of social patterns and evolution of sociality.},

When a compromise is impossible, the group splits in order to reduce conflict of interests and favour positive social interactions between its members. In this study we built a dynamic model of social networks to represent a succession of temporary fissions involving a change in social relations that could potentially lead to irreversible group fission (i.e. no more group fusion). This is the first study that assesses how a social network changes according to group fission-fusion dynamics. We built a model that was based on different parameters: the group size, the influence of nutritional needs compared to social needs, and the changes in the social network after a temporary fission. The results obtained from this theoretical data indicate how the percentage of social relation transfer, the number of individuals and the relative importance of nutritional requirements and social links influence the average number of days before irreversible fission occurs. The greater the nutritional needs and the higher the transfer of social relations during temporary fission, the fewer days will be observed before an irreversible fission. It is crucial to bridge the gap between the individual and the population level if we hope to understand how simple, local interactions may drive ecological systems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the formation and function of the multilevelled, fission–fusion social structure in a free-ranging African elephant, Loxodonta africana, population. We quantitatively identified the existence of four social tiers by using cluster analysis on individual association data. We assessed the effects of season and study period on social structuring and levels of cohesion within and among social units. We found that second-tier units, potentially the equivalent of the ‘family’, were stable across seasonal periods but the number of units increased as the study progressed and the population grew. It appears that these units were sufficiently small not to be influenced by ecologically related factors, such as resource competition, that might otherwise lead to them splitting. On the other hand, third- and fourth-tier units were significantly affected by season in a way that suggests a trade-off between ecological costs (e.g. from resource competition) and different social and ecological benefits (e.g. from predator defence, territoriality, knowledge sharing and rearing of young). Age structure also appeared to influence this multitiered social organization. The size of second-tier social units was significantly affected by the age of matriarchs: units lead by matriarchs likely to be grandmothers (i.e. females 35 years and older) were significantly larger than those lead by younger matriarchs. We present a conceptual framework for understanding the emergence of multiple-tier social structure from interactions driven by socioecological processes. This study is the first to use rigorous quantitative methods to statistically show the existence of four hierarchical tiers of social organization in a nonhuman animal. Additionally, our results elucidate the role that ecological processes play in producing complex social structures.},

These dynamics have major implications at both population and individual levels, exerting an important influence on patterns of social behaviour, information transfer and epidemiology. However, fission–fusion dynamics in birds have received relatively little attention. We review the existing evidence for fission–fusion sociality in birds alongside a more general explanation of the social and ecological processes that may drive fission–fusion dynamics. Through a combination of recent methodological developments and novel technologies with well-established areas of ornithological research, avian systems offer great potential to further our understanding of fission–fusion social systems and the consequences they have at an individual and population level. In particular, investigating the interaction between social structure and environmental covariates can promote a deeper understanding of the evolution of social behaviour and the adaptive value of group living, as well as having important consequences for applied research.},

We investigate the influence of fruit tree abundance and foraging environment heterogeneity on fission–fusion dynamics in a group of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. We collected 1300 h of behavioral data and 23 samples of biweekly ecological data from August 2009 to July 2010. We measured fission–fusion dynamics through the temporal variation in the size and composition of subgroups, the spatial dispersion within and between subgroups, and the frequency of fissions and fusions. We measured habitat-wide food abundance of preferred species, including two that differ greatly in their relative abundance: Brosimum alicastrum (a hyperabundant resource) and Ficus spp. (a not so abundant resource but often represented by large trees). We evaluated the foraging environment heterogeneity through the variance in the number of trees with fruit between species. Our results show that, although habitat-wide food abundance is important, the availability of key resources strongly influences the spider monkeys’ fission–fusion dynamics. When there was a high abundance of fruit of Brosimum, subgroups tended to be more stable, smaller, and mixed sex, and their members remained close. In contrast, when Brosimum trees with fruit were scarce, females often formed large, more fluid and dispersed subgroups. Foraging environment heterogeneity had a positive effect on within-subgroup spatial dispersion and rates of fission and fusion. The complex relationships we have uncovered suggest that the flexibility afforded by fission–fusion dynamics is an adaptation to highly variable foraging environments.},

We investigated the dynamics of group formation in a population of roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, living in open cultivated plain. Our results show the high spontaneous instability of groups. The probability of fission per unit time increased approximately as the square of group size, and the sizes of the groups resulting from a splitting-up followed a uniform distribution. Attraction between groups was the main cause of fusion and was at work over distances of more than 200m, far exceeding the perception radius of roe deer in forest. In addition, when not yet separated by than more than 200m, two groups resulting from a single splitting-up had a high probability of remerging and restoring the parent group. Our results are thus consistent with the assumption that in large herbivores group size increases with habitat openness, not because of a change in individual's behaviour, but because groups are unstable and any increase of the distance at which animals perceive one another enhances the rate at which groups merge.},

	abstract = {Despite the large number of movement studies, the constraints that grouping imposes on movement decisions remain essentially unexplored, even for highly social species. Such constraints could be key, however, to understanding the dynamics and spatial organisation of species living in group fusion-fission systems. We investigated the winter movements (speed and diffusion coefficient) of groups of free-ranging roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), in an agricultural landscape characterised by a mosaic of food and foodless patches. Most groups were short-lived units that merged and split up frequently during the course of a day. Deer groups decreased their speed and diffusion rate in areas where food patches were abundant, as well as when travelling close to main roads and crest lines and far from forests. While accounting for these behavioural adjustments to habitat features, our study revealed some constraints imposed by group foraging: large groups reached the limit of their diffusion rate faster than small groups. The ability of individuals to move rapidly to new foraging locations following patch depression thus decreases with group size. Our results highlight the importance of considering both habitat heterogeneity and group dynamics when predicting the movements of individuals in group fusion-fission societies. Further, we provide empirical evidence that group cohesion can restrain movement and, therefore, the speed at which group members can explore their environment. When maintaining cohesion reduces foraging gains because of movement constraints, leaving the group may become a fitness-rewarding decision, especially when individuals can join other groups located nearby, which would tend to maintain highly dynamical group fusion-fission systems. Our findings also provide the basis for new hypotheses explaining a broad range of ecological patterns, such as the broader diet and longer residency time reported for larger herbivore groups.},

Such conflicts result in group break-ups, and are therefore a fundamental driver of fusion–fission group dynamics. Yet, a paucity of empirical work hampers our understanding of how adaptive evolution has shaped plasticity in collective behaviours that promote and maintain fusion–fission dynamics. Using movement data from GPS-collared bison, we found that individuals constantly associated with other animals possessing different spatial knowledge, and both personal and conspecific information influenced an individual's patch choice decisions. During conflict situations, bison used group familiarity coupled with their knowledge of local foraging options and recently sampled resource quality when deciding to follow or leave a group – a tactic that led to energy-rewarding movements. Natural selection has shaped collective behaviours for coping with social conflicts and resource heterogeneity, which maintain fusion–fission dynamics and play an essential role in animal distribution.},

Such structure may lead to behavioural diversity not only among populations, but also within a single population, where different subsets of a population may exhibit different types of behaviour. As a consequence, understanding social structure is not only interesting biologically, but may also help conservation and management efforts, because not all segments of a population necessarily respond to or interact with human activities in the same way, or at the same time. In this study, we examined the social structure of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Gulf of Trieste and adjacent waters (northern Adriatic Sea), based on a 9-year dataset, using social network metrics and association indices. We assessed whether different segments of the population show differences in behaviour and interactions with fisheries. Dolphin social network was structured into distinct social clusters of mixed sexes. We found no evidence of male alliances. The two largest social clusters overlapped spatially, but not temporally, as they used the same area at different times of day. Such diel temporal partitioning does not appear to have been documented in cetaceans previously. The two clusters also differed in ways they interact with fisheries, as one regularly interacted with trawlers, while the other did not. This study demonstrates how different segments of animal populations can interact differently with human activities and in turn respond differently to anthropogenic impacts.},

Large group sizes are routinely used in livestock production and, due to the restricted space allowance, offer minimal opportunities for dispersal. The existence of sub-grouping behaviour in large groups of pigs, a species which adopts a hierarchical social structure in smaller groups, was investigated. The existence of, and affinity to, preferred resting locations and dependency between individuals in their choice of resting locations were investigated in groups of 20 and 80 growing pigs housed indoors. The role of physical attributes of the animals in determining spacing behaviour was also examined. Pigs in both group sizes exhibited resting location preferences, but clustering around the mean location was more dispersed in the larger groups. Pigs in groups of 80 therefore rested alongside a greater number of individuals than those in groups of 20. Little evidence was found in the larger groups for dependency between individuals in their choice of resting locations. Despite the presence of preferred resting locations, this non-random space use did not result in the emergence of sub-groups under indoor conditions in which phenotypic variation between individuals was slight.},

	abstract = {Living in a large social group is thought to increase disease risk in wild animal populations, but comparative studies have provided mixed support for this prediction. Here, we take a social network perspective to investigate whether patterns of social contact within groups influence parasite risk. Specifically, increased modularity (i.e. sub-grouping) in larger groups could offset the increased disease risk associated with living in a large group. We simulated the spread of a contagious pathogen in random social networks to generate theoretically grounded predictions concerning the relationship between social network connectivity and the success of socially transmitted pathogens. Simulations yielded the prediction that community modularity (Q) negatively impacts parasite success. No clear predictions emerged for a second network metric we considered, the eigenvector centralization index (C), as the relationship between this measure and parasite success depended on the transmission probability of parasites. We then tested the prediction that Q reduces parasite success in a phylogenetic comparative analysis of social network modularity and parasite richness across 19 primate species. Using a Bayesian implementation of phylogenetic generalized least squares and controlling for sampling effort, we found that primates living in larger groups exhibited higher Q, and as predicted by our simulations, higher Q was associated with lower richness of socially transmitted parasites. This suggests that increased modularity mediates the elevated risk of parasitism associated with living in larger groups, which could contribute to the inconsistent findings of empirical studies on the association between group size and parasite risk. Our results indicate that social networks may play a role in mediating pressure from socially transmitted parasites, particularly in large groups where opportunities for transmitting communicable diseases are abundant. We propose that parasite pressure in gregarious primates may have favored the evolution of behaviors that increase social network modularity, especially in large social groups.},

As a result, theoretical and empirical contact network models of infectious disease spread are increasingly providing valuable insights into wildlife epidemiology. Analyzing an exceptionally detailed dataset on contact structure within a high-density population of European badgers Meles meles, we show that a modular contact network produced by spatially structured stable social groups, lead to smaller epidemics, particularly for infections with intermediate transmissibility. The key advance is that we identify considerable variation among individuals in their role in disease spread, with these new insights made possible by the detail in the badger dataset. Furthermore, the important impacts on epidemiology are found even though the modularity of the Badger network is much lower than the threshold that previous work suggested was necessary. These findings reveal the importance of stable social group structure for disease dynamics with important management implications for socially structured populations.},

	abstract = {Wild boars Sus scrofa have a social organization based on female groups that can include several generations of adults and offspring, and are thus likely matrilineal. However, little is known about the degree of relatedness between animals living in such groups or occupying the same core area of spatial activity. Also, polygynous male mating combined with matrilineal female groups can have strong influences on the genetic structure of populations. We used microsatellite genotyping combined with behavioral data to investigate the fine-scale population genetic structure and the mating system of wild boars in a multi-year study at Châteauvillain-Arc-en-Barrois (France). According to spatial genetic autocorrelation, females in spatial proximity were significantly inter-related. However, we found that numerous males contributed to the next generation, even within the same social group. Based on our genetic data and behavioral observations, wild boars in this population appear to have a low level of polygyny associated with matrilineal female groups, and infrequent multiple paternity. Mortality due to hunting may facilitate the breakup of what historically has been a more predominantly polygynous mating system, and likely accelerates the turnover of adults within the matrilineal groups.},

Simultaneous pairs of radio locations were used to assess behavioural associations among pigs, and DNA fingerprinting was used to determine genetic similarity.

Similarity of behavioural dendrograms to genetic dendrograms indicated that genetic relationships of feral pigs played a role in observed population structure. A single discrepancy between genetic and behavioural dendrograms suggested two animals dispersed to an adjacent sounder. Also, one sounder appeared to have been created by fission from a larger, adjacent sounder.

Given the spatiotemporal complexity inherent to animal movements, the interaction between movement behavior and a location is often oversimplified in commonly applied analyses of tracking data. We analyzed GPS-tracking-derived metrics of intensity of use, structural properties (based on network theory), and properties of the movement path (speed and directionality) with machine learning to define homogeneous spatial movement types. We applied our approach to a long-term tracking data set of over 130 African elephants (Loxodonta africana) in an area under pressure from infrastructure development. We identified 5 unique location-specific movement categories displayed by elephants, generally defined as high, medium, and low use intensity, and 2 types of connectivity corridors associated with fast and slow movements. High-use and slow-movement corridors were associated with similar landscape characteristics associated with productive areas near water, whereas low-use and fast corridors were characterized by areas of low productivity farther from water. By combining information on intensity of use, properties of movement paths, and structural aspects of movement across the landscape, our approach provides an explicit definition of the functional role of areas for movement across the landscape that we term the movescape. This combined, high-resolution information regarding wildlife space use offers mechanistic information that can improve landscape planning.},

          Movement links the distribution of habitats with the social environment of animals using those habitats; yet integrating movement, habitat selection, and socioecology remains an opportunity. Here, our objective was to disentangle the roles of habitat selection and social association as drivers of collective movement in a gregarious ungulate. To accomplish this objective, we (1) assessed whether socially familiar individuals form discrete social communities and whether social communities have high spatial, but not necessarily temporal, overlap and (2) modelled the relationship between collective movement and selection of foraging habitats using socially informed integrated step selection analysis. Based on assignment of individuals to social communities and home range overlap analyses, individuals assorted into discrete social communities and these communities had high spatial overlap. By unifying social network analysis with movement ecology, we identified state-dependent social association, where individuals were less cohesive when foraging, but were cohesive when moving collectively between foraging patches. Our study demonstrates that social behaviour and space use are inter-related based on spatial overlap of social communities and state-dependent habitat selection. Movement, habitat selection, and social behaviour are linked in theory. Here, we put these concepts into practice to demonstrate that movement is the glue connecting individual habitat selection to the social environment.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          When studying social behaviour, it can be important to determine whether the behaviour being recorded is actually driven by the social preferences of individuals. Many studies of animal social networks therefore attempt to disentangle social preferences from spatial preferences or restrictions. As such, there are a large number of techniques with which to test whether results from network analysis can be explained by random interactions, or interactions driven by similarities in space use. Selecting which of these methods to use will require determining to what extent space might influence social structure. Here we present a simple method (Social Spatial Community Assignment Test) to quantify the similarity between social and spatial group structure. We then apply this method to both simulated and empirical data of social interactions to demonstrate that it can successfully tease apart social and spatial explanations for groups. We first show that it can resolve the relative importance of space and social preferences in three simulated datasets in which interaction patterns are driven purely by space use, purely by social preferences or a mixture of the two. We then apply it to empirical data from a long-term study of free-ranging house mice. We find that while social structure is similar to spatial structure, there is still evidence for individuals possessing social preferences, with the importance of these preferences fluctuating between seasons. Our method provides a robust way of assessing the overlap between spatial and social structure, which will be invaluable to researchers when investigating the underlying drivers of social structure in wild populations.},

The composition of such groupings is important for numerous research directions, but their characterization is challenged by data sampling issues. In wild populations, where individuals range over large distances and observation can be limited, social data required to resolve community structure are difficult to collect. Recent studies used simulated data sets to determine the robustness of individual level network metrics under suboptimal sampling conditions, but the sensitivity of community detection algorithms to imperfect sampling has not been assessed. Here, we used simulated data sets to determine how sampling effort and skew influence the ability of three community detection algorithms (fastgreedy, walktrap and louvain) to recover the ‘true’ community structure of networks under two sampling regimes (field-based observational sampling and sampling through biologgers, e.g. proximity detectors). We also examined the robustness of a measure of uncertainty in estimated community structure (rcom). We based our simulated societies on contact patterns in wild male African elephants, a model system reflecting common sampling challenges of large wild populations. Our results indicate that the accuracy of the algorithms improved with increasing sampling effort and decreasing sampling skew. Under the field sampling regime, when sampling effort is constrained, mid-levels of sampling skew may provide a reasonable compromise between maximizing the mean numbers of observation per individual and minimizing sampling skew. Even with skewed data, rcom can provide a reliable measure of uncertainty in the estimated community assignments, but it should be interpreted cautiously with highly skewed data. The network structures explored represent common sampling challenges for wild populations, but unexplored sampling regimes may drive somewhat different dynamics. Our simulations indicate that adequate sampling even when skewed can be informative and maximization of the number of observations among all individuals should be a general objective.},

Through combining the automated tracking of winter flocks of over 500 wild great tits (Parus major) with removal experiments, we assessed how individuals' social network positions responded to the loss of their social associates. We found that the extent of flockmate loss that individuals experienced correlated positively with subsequent increases in the number of their social associations, the average strength of their bonds and their overall connectedness within the social network (defined as summed edge weights). Increased social connectivity was not driven by general disturbance or changes in foraging behaviour, but by modifications to fine-scale social network connections in response to losing their associates. Therefore, the reduction in social connectedness expected by individual loss may be mitigated by increases in social associations between remaining individuals. Given that these findings demonstrate rapid adjustment of social network associations in response to the loss of previous social ties, future research should examine the generality of the compensatory adjustment of social relations in ways that maintain the structure of social organization.},

We took advantage of the ecological conditions of our study area, inhabited by different ungulate species, to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of Capreolus capreolus, Dama dama and Sus scrofa. We estimated intraspecific interaction arising from the concomitant use of resources by using camera trapping. We collected 2741 videos with the three ungulates, which showed peculiar activity patterns. The three species were observed in all the habitat types of the study area over the four seasons, thus highlighting an evident spatial overlap. Moreover, our analysis demonstrated that the three species did not avoid each other through temporal segregation of their activities, rather showing a high overlap of daily activity rhythms, though with differences among the species and the seasons. Despite the high spatial and temporal overlap, the three species seemed to adopt segregation through fine-scale spatial avoidance: at an hourly level, the proportion of sites where the species were observed together was relatively low. This spatio-temporal segregation revealed complex and alternative behavioural strategies, which likely facilitated intra-guild sympatry among the studied species. Both temporal and spatio-temporal overlap reached the highest values in summer, when environmental conditions were more demanding. Given these results, we may presume that different drivers (e.g. temperature, human disturbance), which are likely stronger than interspecific interactions, affected activity rhythms and fine-scale spatial use of the studied species.},

This could also be true for animals under commercial conditions, but research in this area has been limited. Pigs for example are known to be very social animals, but information about their grouping behavior is mostly derived from wild boars and a limited number of studies in seminatural and commercial conditions. Specifically under commercial conditions it is still unclear to what extent pig herds organize themselves in subgroups and how such group patterns emerge. To answer these questions, we tracked the positions of about 200 sows inside a barn during ongoing production over a period of five weeks and used these data to construct and analyze the animal contact networks. Our analysis showed a very high contact density and only little variation in the number of other animals that a specific animal is in contact with. Nevertheless, in each week we consistently detected three subgroups inside the barn, which also showed a clear spatial separation. Our results show that even in the high density environment of a commercial pig farm, the behavior of pigs to form differentiated groups is consistent with their behavior under seminatural conditions. Furthermore, our findings also imply that the barn layout could play an important role in the formation of the grouping pattern. These insights could be used to monitor and understand the spread of infectious diseases inside the barn better. In addition, our insights could potentially be used to improve the welfare of pigs.},

We simultaneously recorded {\textgreater} 8000 associations from 85\% of breeding individuals from a colony of Australasian gannets (Morus serrator) over a 2-week period, and examined gregariousness across four foraging states using multilayer social network analysis. We found that social associations varied in a context-dependent manner, highlighting that social associations are most prevalent during foraging (local enhancement) and in regions expected to provide clustered resources. We also provide evidence of individual consistency in gregariousness, but flexibility in social associates, demonstrating that individuals can adjust their social behaviours to match experienced conditions.},

	abstract = {Play fighting can originate from different behavioural systems, including aggression and affiliation and can have a competitive and/or cooperative nature. Domestic pigs engage in vigorous play fighting that strongly resembles real fighting in motor patterns from their first days of life and heavier subjects usually win agonistic contests. Here we tested whether play fighting in piglets could be a substitute for real fighting and predicted that, if so: (1) play invitations would be more successful when not involving possibly dangerous body contact (Prediction 1); (2) piglets would preferentially play with similar-sized mates, easier to outcompete (Prediction 2); (3) play fighting and real fighting outcomes (winner/loser) and social networks would largely match (Prediction 3). We videorecorded three litters of preweaning piglets housed at the ethical farm Parva Domus (Turin, Italy) and analysed the play, aggression and suckling sessions. Sociomatrix and social network analyses were also used to compare play fighting and real fighting. Our findings confirmed all predictions, as they showed that piglets engaged in play fighting when the danger of being harmed was lowest (no-contact invitation patterns; Prediction 1) and their chance of winning was highest (similar weight players; Prediction 2). During the preweaning period, play fighting decreased as real fighting increased and just after suckling time declined, with piglets consistently winning/losing both playful and real fights and possessing comparable network centrality values in both play fighting and real fighting networks (Prediction 3). Although the mechanisms underlying the competitive nature of play fighting remain to be determined, this study provides evidence that it can be a harmless replacement for real fighting (possibly mediated by the oxytocin consumed via maternal milk). This study also points towards the more extreme hypothesis that play fighting is a different form of aggression that includes elements of play.},
